# 📝 To-Do List (My Second Project)

**📆 Created - End:** September 24th, 2024 - September 26th, 2024
**🧠 Purpose:** Practice handling lists, user input, and basic program flow in Python.  

After building my first game (Blackjack), I wanted to create something more practical —  
so I built this simple To-Do List app using the console.

### ✨ Features
- Create and name a task list
- Add and remove tasks
- Mark tasks as done ✅
- Simple console interface with colors and emoji
